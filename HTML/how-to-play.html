    <h1>How to Play Nonogram</h1>

    <p>Nonogram is also known as Picross or Griddlers. Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid are colored or left blank depending on the hidden picture embedded in the grid.
       The grid contains numbers at the top of the grid and to the left of the grid, these numbers tell you if there are a group of consecutive black squares somewhere in that row or column.
       If there is more than one number in a row or column, it indicates that there are multiple groups of colored squares in that row or column separated by white spaces.
    </p>

    <p>In the example below, a 3 in a row or column means that somewhere in that row or column there is a colored block that can be revealed in the grid.
       If there are multiple numbers, that means there are multiple groups of colored blocks in the grid of that row or column separated by white spaces, as shown in the example
       below with 3 3 on the left side of the grid.
